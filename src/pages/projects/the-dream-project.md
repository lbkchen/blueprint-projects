  A nonprofit based in the Dominican Republic, The DREAM Project aims to provide
  education services to empower at-risk children and youth to create a better
  future for themselves and their families through high quality education, youth
  development, and community enrichment.
intro:
  blurb: >-
    DREAM serves more than 8200 children in 14 different programs. They came to
    Blueprint, because they needed an attendance tracking system that could work
    online and offline, giving the unreliable Wi-Fi connections in their school
    locations.

  - name: Online and Offline Attendance Taking
    text: >-
      DREAM's schools are located in areas where Wi-Fi can be very limited, so
      it is essential to be able to take attendance without an internet
      connection. We have digitalized and streamlined the entire process,
      removing the logistical overhead that may become roadblocks to students'
      effective education and learning.
  - name: Mid-semester Enrollments
    text: >-
      One case that often comes up in DREAM schools is the issue of mid-semester
      enrollments. Since students often drop in and out of DREAM programs, we
      wanted a way to easily enroll students into and unenroll students from
      their courses. The system is designed to be versatile enough that DREAM
      admins and teachers can easily search for existing students and alter
      their enrollment statuses, all within the mobile app.
  - name: Foreign Language Support
    text: >-
      DREAM is based in the Dominican Republic and the primary language for many
      of their volunteers and teachers is Spanish. We support versions of the
      application both in English and Spanish.
